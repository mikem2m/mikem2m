## Hello there! I'm Michael 👋

👋 - I am a software engineer with a passion towards continuous learning of new and exciting technologies!

🏫 - I completed my bachelors of applied science, specialized in mechanical engineering from the University of British Columbia in 2021.

💻 - Despite finishing undergraduate education, I still wanted to expand my knowledge through self-learning. My curiosity in the realm of software development & engineering has motivated and perpetuated myself to learn about computer science and programming! (From 2019 until Now).

💼 - What started as a hobby has sparked into a career that I am absolutely passionate about. I am currently working as a Full-Stack Intermediate Software Engineer working primarily on the backend side of things as well as some DevOps-related areas.

📖 - The learning does not stop after the workday is over! Outside of work, I still like to learn about new technologies to sharpen my software engineering skillset! Some recent examples of this includes learning about Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization in Java, as well as diving deep into the world of DevOps, through the use of AWS's Solution Architect Associate certification.

📅 - I'm currently enrolled in UBC's Master of Data Science program to expand both my interest and knowledge in the AI/ML's realm of software engineering. I will be graduating in June 2025.

📷 - Outside of programming, I also make YouTube videos. IDV is a channel that aims to help people living abroad through series of stories, lessons and experiences regarding the international life.

💬 - I believe that I will be a great addition to any team as I would aid them in creating the best inventions out there! All I need is an opportunity for me to do exactly that!
